# mandatJobtrek

This project is an application for our company [Jobtrek](https://jobtrek.ch/).

Our goal is to Create a web application for Jobtrek employees to collect and visualize different data (e.g. number of internships, satisfaction questionnaire, etc.). The software (Oauth) must give the possibility to connect the user with his Microsoft account and allow him to access only specific data according to the "authorizations". It must also be able to contain graphics that update automatically (2-3 times per day (to be defined)).
